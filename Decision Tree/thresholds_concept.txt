Purpose of Thresholds

1. Binary Decision Making :
   - A threshold allows for a binary decision based on whether a feature's value is below or above a certain point. For example:
     - If the threshold for Feature 1 is 2, the decision would split the data into two groups:
       - Group 1: Values ≤ 2 (1, 2)
       - Group 2: Values > 2 (3, 4)

2. Segmentation of Data:
   - By applying different thresholds, the algorithm can segment the dataset into subsets that can be analyzed separately. This segmentation helps in identifying patterns or classes more effectively.

3. Maximizing Information Gain:
   - The goal of the decision tree algorithm is to find the threshold that maximizes the information gain (or minimizes impurity) when splitting the data.
   - Each threshold is evaluated based on how well it separates the target classes (e.g., for a binary classification task, separating class 0 from class 1).

 Example with Unique Thresholds

Example:

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Target |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1         | 0         | 0      |
| 2         | 0         | 0      |
| 3         | 1         | 1      |
| 4         | 1         | 1      |

 Unique Thresholds for Feature 1

- Unique values in Feature 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- The algorithm will evaluate each of these unique values as potential thresholds for splitting the dataset.

 Evaluating Thresholds

1. Threshold = 1:
   - Split: 
     - Group 1: Values ≤ 1 → (1, Target 0)
     - Group 2: Values > 1 → (2, 3, 4, Targets 0, 1, 1)
   - Calculate information gain based on how well this split separates the classes.

2. Threshold = 2:
   - Split:
     - Group 1: Values ≤ 2 → (1, 2, Targets 0, 0)
     - Group 2: Values > 2 → (3, 4, Targets 1, 1)
   - Calculate information gain for this split.

3. Threshold = 3:
   - Split:
     - Group 1: Values ≤ 3 → (1, 2, 3, Targets 0, 0, 1)
     - Group 2: Values > 3 → (4, Target 1)
   - Calculate information gain.

4. Threshold = 4:
   - Split:
     - Group 1: Values ≤ 4 → (1, 2, 3, 4, Targets 0, 0, 1, 1)
     - Group 2: No samples (since all values are ≤ 4).
   - Calculate information gain.
